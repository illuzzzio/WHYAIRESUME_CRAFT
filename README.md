Its a easy resume builder using python , i have used framework called reportlab , usign pip install reportlab
i have created various functions inside resume.py file , for the canvas, and different field names in the resume , you can refer to that..

HOW TO RUN :
Clone the github repo using git clone repo_name command..

I created a exe file for the python code using pyinstaller , for for creating new exe file , you can see the command in exe_converter_cmd file..
So all you have to do is , go under the dir called dist and run the file resume.exe , enter the fields , and you can even optimise the resume into one page , using my python code , i have basically removed the unecessary gaps and changed the text size in the code , if your resume overflows to the next page...
the resume will be automatically saved as yourname.pdf format and you can even upload your photo in the resume...
Thank You!
